# gold++ 
A set of rich libraries in C++ which should require C++ 20 support. 

## Note
This project is undergoing construction...

## Goal
* Utilizing modern C++ features and also retain its old functionality.
* Having interpreter called `goldi++` for debugging purposes.
* Simplified and relaxed semantics of some classes. 

## Category
* `gold.format`
* `gold.io`
* `gold.vector`
* `gold.string`
* `gold.value_sequence`
* `gold.type_sequence`
* `gold.tuple`
* `gold.pack`
* `gold.type_name`
* `gold.type_traits`
* `gold.concepts`
* `gold.scope_guard`
* `gold.functional`
* `gold.vocabulary`
* `gold.assertion`
* `gold.macros`
* `gold.struct_array`
* `gold.numbers`
* `gold.random`
* `gold.iterator`
* `gold.ranges`
* `gold.task`
* `gold.generator`
* `gold.unique_ptr`
* `gold.utility`
* `gold.preview.console`
* `gold.preview.graphics`
* `gold.preview.lazy_ranges`
* `gold.preview.linear`

* Input/output, formatting, string streams, manipulators, and file Handling
* Additional built-in data types - string, number
* Rich containers and algebraic data types 
* Console features - colors, canvas
* Keyboard and mouse handling 
* Algorithms - modifying, non-owning, etc.
* File parsing - especially CSV, XML, and JSON 
* Utilites - omnibox, ranges, etc. 
* Windows GUI C++ Wrapper
* OpenGL C++ Wrapper 
* Mathematics - statistics, linear, calculus 
* Logic Programming 

## Modes of Compilation
This library may require only header files, or static libraries, or dynamic linking libraries

## Dependencies 
* OpenGL at least `v3.3` (once `gold.preview.graphics` is available)
